## Task 1
As an appropriate protocol, V2V was agreed upon by the team members. [V2V Communication Protocol.pdf](V2V "Communication Protocol.pdf") describes the inner workings of the protocol and an example project. The [V2V_State_Machine_Diagram.jpg](V2V_State_Machine_Diagram.jpg) is a general state machine for the platooning.

The [CommunicationActivityDiagram.png](CommunicationActivityDiagram.png) represents the communication actions that the truck could make within the platoon.

## Task 2

The [driving activity diagram.pdf](driving "activity diagram.pdf") showcases the actions each truck takes to maintain a suitable speed, distance, and direction. It also ensures that each truck maintains a safe distance to the truck in front. Furthermore, [driving state machine.pdf](driving "state machine.pdf") demonstrates the different states of a truck in regards to driving and the events that could happen.

Finally, [ActivityDiagram Communication Failure.png](ActivityDiagram "Communication Failure.png") deals with communication failure in the platoon.
